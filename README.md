## Baseball Analytics Project

This is my final project for Introduction to Data Science at Middlebury College in Spring 2019. I analyzed trends in baseball game characteristics in R and
compared them to baseball viewership and game attendance records, and pulled conclusions about the future of the sport. This repository includes a datasets 
directory holding two of the csv data sets used in the project (the others were scraped directly offline from R script), an R script and markdown file with my 
code, and a docs directory holding the knitted html file of my project, which can be viewed [here](https://dangause.github.io/baseball_analytics_project/).
